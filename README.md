# WatchMyHands
A smartwatch that translates ASL to text, empowering the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

Welcome to the documentation for our computer vision-based watch that can convert American Sign Language (ASL) to English and vice versa. This watch uses machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to interpret and translate sign language in real-time.

Overview

Our watch is a wearable device that has a built-in camera and a screen to display the translated text. It uses computer vision algorithms to capture hand movements and convert them into text. The machine learning model used in this watch has been trained on a large dataset of ASL gestures and corresponding English translations.
Requirements

To use our watch, you will need the following requirements:

    A computer with a webcam (if you want to contribute to the project)
    A smartphone (for connecting to the watch via Bluetooth)
    A 3D printer (if you want to print the watch case)

Installation
